<p class="tst1" id="tst2">Guwahati is where much of Assam's city glitter resides. So, while most of the other towns in the state will offer you local preparations in local food joints and a few restaurants, Guwahati sparkles with choices only a commercially developed city can offer.
Guwahati sustains the local Assamese foods in its menu such as Nga-Thongba which is a fish and ginger curry, Erongba, a jackfruit-kernel chutney, Laksa and a lot more, and at the same time offers everything from Indian, Mughlai, Chinese to Continental cuisines and a few more. 
Indulge yourself in the pastas, pizzas, cakes and pasteries widely available in the area. You can also relax and enjoy in a number of bars and pubs that the city has to offer.</p><h4><font size=5>
